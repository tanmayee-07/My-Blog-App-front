            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">Hi everybody! This is Tanmayee Choudhury, a third year Btech student at VIT, Vellore.
             Everyday I wake up, munch on some carbs, get busy with certain specialized stuffs and then return to sleep.
            </p>
            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">During the lockdown period, I wandered out into exploring my inner self, my intrinsic gifts and capacities.
             Thus, subsequent to going through philosophical rumination about existence for pretty long hours, I’ve at last chosen to pen down my thoughts that would get you working with all your heart and soul.
             I would be sharing my technical knowledge with the world as well. Eventually, when writing becomes a habit, you automate it and prevent all the overthinking and resistance you face as a writer to get started.
            </p>
            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4"><em>Today, do just a little bit more.
                 Turn going the extra mile into a habit — it is what lifts most successful people above the crowd.” — Bob Proctor</em>
            </p>
            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
            As cited by Bob Proctor above, consistently attempt to walk an extra mile, factor in some extra enthusiasm in order to stand out.
             Believe in a healthy attitude, one that is contagious.
             But do not wait to catch it from others. Be a carrier!
            </p>
            <p className="mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
            Well, that’s about it for my introduction.
             I’ll be racing my way to first 10 articles as a challenge to transform myself from a Rookie blogger to a well-versed writer.
             At any cost, regardless of the roadblocks I face as an engineering student, exciting times are surely ahead, so stay tuned!
            </p>
